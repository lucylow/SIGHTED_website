        <p>
          SIGHTED is a cutting-edge healthcare data privacy solution. By integrating with Calimero's framework, SIGHTED facilitates the development of self-sovereign applications that prioritize data privacy and security in healthcare. At its core, SIGHTED utilizes zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enable secure and private data sharing among healthcare stakeholders. This implementation allows healthcare providers to verify and validate patient information without exposing the actual data, effectively addressing the challenges of privacy and trust in data transactions.

1) Permissioned Private Shard Owned by a Single Entity
This mode allows for the most controlled environment where a single entity, such as a hospital or healthcare network, owns the shard. Access control is strict, and permissions are finely managed for each role.
* Primary Care Provider (PCP) and Radiologist: As internal users in this single-entity shard, they receive access to patient data per the organization’s policies. Data sharing is limited to users within the entity, preventing external access.
* Insurance Company: The insurance company can access patient claims only by secure APIs with strict, contract-based access (e.g., Zero-Knowledge Proofs) that reveal minimal information for claim verification.
* Patient: The patient can view their records and selectively grant or revoke access to specific doctors or departments within the hospital. They retain control over their data with access logs provided by the entity.


2) Permissioned Private Shard Owned by a Consortium
Here, a consortium of healthcare providers and insurance companies jointly owns the shard. This mode allows for cross-institutional data access and sharing under strict policies, where each entity can manage role-based access across multiple parties while maintaining patient data privacy.
* Primary Care Provider (PCP) and Radiologist: PCPs and radiologists from any entity within the consortium can access patient records per their role permissions. For example, a PCP from one hospital can access imaging data from a radiologist at another consortium hospital, providing coordinated care across facilities.
* Insurance Company: Insurance companies in the consortium have permission to access claims data only, without access to broader medical histories. Zero-Knowledge Proofs are used for privacy-preserving verification across entities.
* Patient: Patients can authorize specific providers across the consortium to view or update their records. They benefit from seamless care coordination without losing control over who accesses their information.


3) Public Shard Owned by a Community
In this mode, SIGHTED operates in a more open environment where patients and providers form a decentralized community, using smart contracts for permissions. Here, transparency is high, yet patient data remains private through encryption and selective access.
* Primary Care Provider (PCP) and Radiologist: Providers can access patient data only with explicit patient approval. Any access request is transparent, allowing patients to manage permissions independently in a community-driven environment.
* Insurance Company: Insurance companies, as members of the public shard, can process claims, but data access is limited to required information only. Claims verification relies heavily on Zero-Knowledge Proofs for community compliance and transparency.
* Patient: Patients are the true owners of their data, with full autonomy to grant or deny access to any provider or insurance company. This setup maximizes control, transparency, and privacy, as data cannot be accessed without explicit consent.

Secure Medical Records Sharing : A healthcare application that enables the secure and private sharing of medical records between patients and healthcare providers, using Calimero for privacy-preserving access. For the Privacy-Preserving Access aspect of the SIGHTED system, each role can have specific permissions for accessing and interacting with medical data, using access-control policies and privacy-preserving mechanisms.

Key Features:
* Patient-Controlled Data: Patients retain full control over who accesses their data, enabling them to grant or revoke access as needed.
* Auditable Transactions: All data-sharing actions are recorded on the blockchain, allowing for traceability without revealing sensitive information. This audit trail can be used to monitor compliance with privacy regulations.
* Enhanced Security: Advanced cryptographic techniques ensure that data remains secure both in transit and at rest, significantly reducing the risk of data breaches.
* Granular Access Controls: Healthcare providers can set fine-grained permissions, allowing for tailored access to patient data based on specific needs and roles.
* Scalable Architecture: Built on the NEAR Protocol, SIGHTED is designed to scale efficiently, accommodating increasing numbers of users and data without sacrificing performance.
* Real-Time Data Sharing: Facilitates real-time data sharing among healthcare providers, improving patient care and coordination while maintaining privacy.
* Regulatory Compliance: SIGHTED is designed with compliance in mind, ensuring adherence to healthcare regulations like HIPAA, thereby protecting patient rights and privacy.
Through these technical implementations and key features, SIGHTED effectively addresses the pressing need for secure and private data sharing in the healthcare industry, enabling stakeholders to maintain trust while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.

Secure Medical Records Sharing : A healthcare application that enables the secure and private sharing of medical records between patients and healthcare providers, using Calimero for privacy-preserving access. For the Privacy-Preserving Access aspect of the SIGHTED system, each role can have specific permissions for accessing and interacting with medical data, using access-control policies and privacy-preserving mechanisms.


The patient has full access to their medical records and can approve or revoke access to their data as needed, offering them control over their privacy.
PRIVACY-PRESERVING ACCESS CONFIGURATION:
* Self-Sovereign Control: Patients have the ability to provide selective access to their data and can revoke permissions at any time.
* End-to-End Encryption: Patients’ records are encrypted, and they can use their private key to share or hide parts of their data selectively.

Using Calimero's privacy-preserving capabilities with NEAR's secure smart contracts, each role can have fine-grained, controlled access to patient records, ensuring data privacy while enabling necessary medical workflows. This setup allows SIGHTED to securely manage data sharing and maintain patient autonomy over personal information.

          <h4>Primary Care Provider (PCP)</h4>
          <p>The PCP is typically the main custodian of a patient’s medical records. With privacy-preserving access, the PCP can access the patient’s core medical history but with controls over sensitive details.
PRIVACY-PRESERVING ACCESS CONFIGURATION:
* Role-Based Permissions: The PCP can view and update certain sections of a patient’s record but may have limited access to highly sensitive data.
* Encrypted Data Access: Only the PCP has decryption keys for their assigned records, ensuring patient data remains secure when accessed.

          <h4> Radiologist</h4>
          <p>The radiologist has access to imaging data and specific test results but is restricted from viewing broader patient records unless required for treatment.
PRIVACY-PRESERVING ACCESS CONFIGURATION:
* Selective Access: The radiologist can only access the imaging records and associated notes, minimizing unnecessary exposure to other patient information.
* Temporal Access Control: Access is limited to a specific period or task to prevent persistent access to patient data.

          <h4>Insurance Company</h4>
          <p>The insurance company can access claim-related data to verify and process claims but cannot view detailed patient records.
PRIVACY-PRESERVING ACCESS CONFIGURATION:
* Policy-Based Access Control: Permissions are restricted to claim verification and billing details, not the patient’s complete medical history.
* Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Data required for claims can be validated without disclosing underlying sensitive details, using cryptographic proofs.
